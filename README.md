# Animal-Competition-Game
The Animal Competition Game is a Java-based application that simulates various animal races. The system allows users to set up and manage different types of races , including:

Regular Races: A single animal competes on a user-selected track and runs until the finish line.

Courier Races: Users can create teams of animals, where each team competes against the other. The team whose last animal reaches the finish line first wins.

The system is designed using multi-threading and parallel programming, ensuring that each race runs smoothly and efficiently. It includes features like real-time updates on race progress and an information table that tracks the status of each animal during the race.
